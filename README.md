CT-Scan Image Classification with CNN and XGBoost                                                                      
This project develops a robust image classification system for detecting different types of lung diseases from CT-Scan images.It  involves a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and an XGBoost classifier for the final classification task.
